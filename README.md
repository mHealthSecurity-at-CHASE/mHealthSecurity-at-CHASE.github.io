## Workshop Overview


Mobile health (mHealth) technologies-smartphone apps, wearables, implantables, home monitoring devices, and connected clinical systems-are transforming how healthcare is delivered, monitored, and managed. Yet, these same technologies introduce critical attack surfaces and privacy risks across the data lifecycle, from on-device sensing and communication to cloud analytics and electronic health record (EHR) integration. Securing mHealth systems is therefore essential to maintaining patient trust, safety, and regulatory compliance while enabling innovation in connected health.


The mHealth Security Workshop at IEEE/ACM CHASE 2026 provides a focused forum for researchers, practitioners, clinicians, and policymakers to discuss emerging threats, novel defenses, real-world deployments, and open challenges in securing mobile and connected health ecosystems. The workshop seeks contributions that span theory, system design, implementation, user studies, and policy, with an emphasis on deployable solutions and interdisciplinary collaboration.

## Topics of Interest


Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:


- Threat models, vulnerabilities, and risk assessment for mHealth apps, wearables, and remote monitoring systems

- Secure architectures for end-to-end mHealth data collection, transmission, storage, and analytics

- Lightweight cryptography, secure communication, and key management for resource-constrained devices

- Privacy-preserving data collection and sharing (e.g., anonymization, federated learning, differential privacy)

- Security and privacy of AI/ML models in mHealth (adversarial attacks, model stealing, robustness, secure training)

- Secure mobile sensing and behavior/physiological monitoring, including multimodal and wireless sensing

- Authentication, authorization, access control, and identity management for patients, clinicians, and devices

- Integration security between mHealth platforms, cloud services, IoT devices, and EHR systems

- Usable security and human factors in mHealth (patient and clinician facing interfaces, consent, transparency)

- Policy, regulation, compliance, and ethical considerations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR, international frameworks)

- Security and privacy in telehealth, remote patient monitoring, and home-based care platforms

- Attack detection, anomaly detection, runtime monitoring, and incident response for mHealth infrastructures

- Testbeds, benchmark datasets, tools, and reproducibility frameworks for mHealth security research

- Case studies, pilots, and large-scale deployments of secure mHealth solutions in clinical or community settings

- Security for mHealth in low-resource environments and global health contexts
